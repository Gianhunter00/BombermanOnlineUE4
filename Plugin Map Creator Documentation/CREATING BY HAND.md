## CREATING BY HAND
Here are the steps to create a map using the tool:

- Set the Width and Height of the map.
- If you check the "Are border unbreakable wall?" then when you press "Setup Map" all the borders will be initialized as Unbreakable Wall.
- When you are in the setup to change the type of block to spawn you can just click on the button you want to change:
	- Color Gray means Floor
	- Color Green means Breakable Wall
	- Color Red means Unbreakable Wall
- You can click as much as you want, when the block is Red you can reclick it to make it Gray.
- Once the setup is done press the button "Confirm".
- Last step press the "Create Map" Button and wait, a big map require a bit of time to build.
